# WAVE CONTROLLER
#
# The purpose of this wave controller is to create an App-of-Apps
# that is able to rollout specified Argo CD Application in (sync)waves.
# This is currently not possible with ApplicationSet (end 2023)
#
# Applications that are dependent to each other, or form some kind of
# group should be defined this was.
#
# In this example Secuity Tools are deployed in the following order:
#    1. Configure Allowed Registries
#    2. Deploy and configure Compliance Operator
#    3. Deploy and configure Advanced Cluster Security
#
# The syntax to define the Applications, that shall be managed by
# the App-of-Apps is defined in the helm chart "helper-argocd"
#
# NOTE: It makes sense that the managed Applications are automatically
#       synced.
